 * Revenue fixtures for the M12 ingest suites (ADR-0033, CP2).
 *
 * Two things live here.
 *
 * **`fakeRevenueAdapter`** is a complete `RevenueAdapter` whose every member has
 * a boring default, so a test overrides only the one it is about. That is worth
 * a shared helper rather than five inline object literals: CP1's tests were
 * written against a one-member interface, and CP2 widened it — with per-file
 * stubs, every future widening breaks every suite that ever touched an adapter,
 * and the pressure to answer that by loosening the type is exactly how a stub
 * becomes a second, weaker contract.
 *
 * **The Stripe payload builders** produce the *shapes Stripe actually sends*,
 * with the fields the normalizer reads and nothing invented. A fixture that
 * quietly used a field Stripe does not send would make the normalizer's tests
 * prove something about our imagination.
