/**
 * Every operation binds cleanly from the api's own parameter helper.
 *
 * This exists because of a specific failure mode, and it is one only a
 * ClickHouse-gated CI job used to catch. Every operation's parameter schema is a
 * `strictObject` and `defineOperation` cross-checks the bound keys against the
 * statement's placeholders **in both directions** — so a parameter an operation
 * needs and did not get, and a parameter it got and does not declare, are equally
 * fatal, and both surface as a `VALIDATION_FAILED` at request time rather than at
 * build time. M11 CP3 added three such parameters (`import_cutover`,
 * `import_run_id`, `timezone`) to overlapping but *different* subsets of the
 * registry: the UTC-bucketed charts read the import and take no zone, the live
 * breakdowns take the zone and the cutover but no run id, and `performance` takes
 * none of the three.
 *
 * So the api resolves them from the operation id through one helper, and this
 * walks the whole registry asserting that helper is sufficient and not excessive
 * — for a site with and without a published import, and for two zones. A new
 * operation, or a new bound parameter on an existing one, fails here in
 * milliseconds instead of in a CI round-trip.
