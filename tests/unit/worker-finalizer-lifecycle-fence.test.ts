/**
 * The session finalizer's lifecycle fence (ADR-0030, decision 7).
 *
 * Two layers, and the suite exists because they answer different halves of one
 * race:
 *
 * - The **driver filter** stops a site being picked up at all. Discovery is a
 *   ClickHouse read — "which sites have events" — and a site being deleted still
 *   answers yes right up until its purge runs, so without the filter every sweep
 *   would keep recomputing a site whose analytics are being erased.
 * - The **post-claim re-check** covers the window the filter cannot: a run whose
 *   discovery predates the deletion. It releases the lease rather than holding
 *   it, because the deletion job's `finalizer_fence` phase is waiting for exactly
 *   that lease, and holding it would make the deletion wait out a full TTL for a
 *   run that has already decided it has nothing to do.
 *
 * Everything is faked: what is asserted is which calls happen and in what order,
 * and neither ClickHouse nor Postgres has an opinion about that.
