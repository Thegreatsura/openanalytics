/**
 * The ingest loop's pipeline heartbeat (ADR-0025).
 *
 * The row exists so the read API can tell "this site had no visitors" apart from
 * "we are not processing", and the only thing that makes it able to is *when*
 * the loop writes it: on the loop's own schedule, whether or not the queue had
 * anything in it. A heartbeat written only when a batch flushed would carry the
 * same ambiguity as the watermark it replaces, so the empty tick is the case
 * under test.
 *
 * `tick()` is driven directly rather than through `run()`, so no timers are
 * needed and the throttle can be walked one controlled instant at a time.
