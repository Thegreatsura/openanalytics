/**
 * The revenue adapter port (ADR-0033, D1).
 *
 * An adapter owns **provider semantics only**: whether a credential the customer
 * pasted works, whether a delivered body is authentic, what a provider payload
 * means in canonical terms, and how the provider paginates. The ingest pipeline
 * owns everything else — the ledger, object versioning, checkpoints, the rate
 * budget, the ClickHouse writes — which is what makes the second provider an
 * adapter rather than an architecture.
 *
 * CP1 shipped one member (`verifyCredential`) and said the rest would arrive as
 * new members rather than as stubs; this is that widening. It is additive: the
 * registry below did not change shape, and nothing that consumed CP1's interface
 * had to move.
 *
 * Two rules hold across every member added here, and both come from the same
 * place — an adapter runs against a *customer's own* provider account with a
 * *customer's own* key:
 *
 * - **Nothing throws.** Every outcome is typed, including the network ones.
 *   A throw from the webhook path is a 500 on a signed delivery Stripe will
 *   retry forever; a throw from the sync path is an unclassified job failure.
 * - **No provider body leaves the adapter.** `detail` strings are categorized —
 *   a status line, a reason word. The body of a response to a customer's key is
 *   not ours to relay into a log, an error envelope or an audit row.
 */

/**
 * What a live credential probe learned.
 *
 * Three outcomes, and the split is the one the whole milestone is named after: a
 * rejected key is the customer's problem and must be reported as such, while an
 * unreachable provider is *ours* and must never be reported as a bad credential
 * (or, worse, as an empty result — docs snapshot 01 §12.3).
 *
 * `detail` is a safe, categorized string. Never a provider response body: the
 * probe's whole purpose is to touch a customer's account with their own
 * credential, and the body of that response is not ours to relay.

 * the event id in the body, so CP2's port could pass a single header string and
 * `revenue-webhook.ts` could keep a provider→header-name map. **Polar cannot be
 * served that way**: it signs Standard Webhooks style over three headers, and
 * its event body carries no id at all — the delivery identity the ledger dedupes
 * on is the `webhook-id` header. A map of header names cannot express that, and
 * growing it would mean the transport layer learning each provider's scheme.
 *
 * So the whole set travels and the adapter picks, which is the split the port
 * already draws everywhere else: transport carries bytes, the adapter owns
 * semantics. The comment in `revenue-webhook.ts` predicted this exact move.
