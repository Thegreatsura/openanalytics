/**
 * The revenue provider catalog (ADR-0033, D1).
 *
 * The same two-layer split M11 used for imports, and for the same reason: a
 * catalog descriptor says what this build offers, and an adapter says how one
 * provider behaves. The frontend renders the catalog, so the picker converges on
 * what the backend can actually do without a redeploy.
 *
 * `available: false` is a *listed* provider rather than an absent one. "Polar is
 * coming" and "Polar is not a thing we do" are different answers, and a screen
 * that can only show working adapters can give only the second.
 *
 * There is no `capability` field here, unlike `ImportProviderDescriptor`. That
 * field exists because a provider's *export* varies in what it contains; every
 * provider in this list connects the same way — an API key plus a webhook — and
 * a field whose value would be identical on all six rows would state nothing.

 * Stripe is the launch provider (F-303, closed by ADR-0033 D1). **Polar is the
 * second, and it arrived as the ADR promised**: an adapter, plus this line
 * changing from `false` to `true`. No migration, no environment variable, no
 * OpenAPI change, no new grant — the provider column was free text by design
 * (`0026_revenue_credentials.sql`) and the framework was the whole point.
 *
 * It was not entirely free. Polar's signature spans three headers and its event
 * body carries no id, which cost the webhook route the provider→header-name map
 * it used to keep — a refactor D4's own comment had already named. That is the
 * boundary this catalog is really testing: a second provider may cost the
 * *transport* a generalization, and must cost the architecture nothing.
 *
 * The remaining four are recorded follow-ups behind the same framework.
