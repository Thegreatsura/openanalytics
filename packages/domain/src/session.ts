/**
 * The canonical analytics sessionizer and its metric definitions
 * (docs snapshot 02 §10 "Visitor, session and metric rules"; 04 Milestone 8
 * items 1 and 5; docs snapshot 05, D-211 and D-102).
 *
 * This is the reference implementation the finalizer (Checkpoint B) recomputes
 * from and the read layer (Checkpoint C) reports from. It is **pure and
 * deterministic**: the same set of persisted events, in any arrival order,
 * produces byte-identical sessions. That property is itself an acceptance
 * criterion (plan Milestone 8 item 4: "deterministic tie-break") and a test.
 *
 * Why a pure re-sessionizer and not an incremental materialized view: D-211. An
 * incremental view sees each inserted block once and cannot un-record a bounce
 * when a second pageview arrives late. Recomputing the session from the full
 * event set is the only thing that can flip a provisional bounce back to
 * engaged, so the whole layer is built as a re-runnable function of the events,
 * versioned in `session_facts_versions` (migration 0013).
 *
 * ## What is a session
 *
 * §10, stated precisely:
 *
 *   - A session is the activity of one visitor with no meaningful gap longer
 *     than 30 minutes. A gap over 30 minutes splits; the client's session hint
 *     can never make a session outlast that rule.
 *   - An SPA route change is a new pageview inside the same session, never a new
 *     session — which falls out naturally here because consecutive pageviews
 *     under the gap rule stay in one session regardless of URL.
 *
 * ### Session identity key (the grouping decision)
 *
 * §10 builds a canonical session from "site + scoped client-session / resolved
 * identity + event ordering". The resolved identity is the M7 expression
 * `if(user_id != '', user_id, anonymous_id)` (ADR-0011), so events are first
 * partitioned by **(site, resolved identity)** — the same visitor key every
 * additive rollup already uses. Within a partition the 30-minute rule splits.
 *
 * The client session hint (`session_id`, the site-scoped HMAC of the tracker's
 * `client_session_id`) is deliberately **not** the partition key, because it is
 * only a hint and must not be able to over- or under-merge:
 *
 *   - **A hint change alone does not split.** Two browser contexts (tabs) of the
 *     same anonymous visitor carry different hints but the same anonymous id and
 *     the same 30-minute continuity, so they stay one session. Partitioning by
 *     hint would have split them; partitioning by identity does not.
 *   - **A shared hint does not merge two unrelated visitors.** The hint is per
 *     tab (`sessionStorage`) and randomly minted, so two people cannot arrive
 *     carrying the same one. What a shared hint under two anonymous ids means is
 *     the opposite: one visitor whose *network* identity moved under them. Two
 *     genuinely different people — two devices behind one NAT, say — carry
 *     different hints and are never merged.
 *
 * ### Identity rotation (D-102)
 *
 * The anonymous id is `HMAC(ip/ua-class, site, UTC-date, key-version)`, so it
 * **rotates at UTC midnight and whenever the IP moves** — a VPN hop, a mobile
 * carrier's CGNAT, an IPv6 temporary address. Either way an un-identified
 * visitor arrives under two anonymous ids — two partitions — carrying the same
 * client session hint. The hint exists precisely for this continuity, so after
 * the per-identity split an **identity bridge** re-joins two adjacent
 * non-identified sessions when, and only when, they
 *
 *   1. are both anonymous (an identified visitor keeps one `user_id` across a
 *      rotation and never needs bridging),
 *   2. share a non-empty client session hint,
 *   3. are within the 30-minute inactivity window, and
 *   4. do not carry the merged span to or past the session cap (ADR-0018).
 *
 * When the rotation is a midnight one the dates must also be *adjacent*, which
 * the inactivity window already implies and which is kept explicit so the
 * cross-day bound is stated in the code that enforces it. The bridge is applied
 * iteratively, so a visit crossing several rotations chains correctly.
 *
 * **Why same-day merging was not always allowed.** It was refused on the
 * assumption that a same-day pair with different anonymous ids is two visitors.
 * Production disproved it: on the dogfood site 24 of 26 split identities over
 * seven days were same-day, one of them reappearing 3 seconds later from the
 * same city — one person, counted twice. The refusal was costing accuracy and
 * buying no privacy.
 *
 * **Privacy consequence, stated openly.** Merging two ids *inside* one UTC day
 * links nothing the daily rotation was protecting: both ids belong to the same
 * day, and the published commitment is about not linking *across* days. The
 * cross-day case is unchanged — still one 30-minute window straddling one UTC
 * midnight, still requiring a matching hint, so it cannot reconstruct long-term
 * cross-day tracking (D-102 keeps that out of core). A session bridged *across a
 * date* is flagged (`midnightBridged`) so that linkage stays visible in the
 * facts; a same-day merge is not flagged, because there is no cross-rotation
 * linkage to disclose. A future persistent-identity mode would need its own
 * privacy ADR; this bridge does not open that door.
 *
 * ### Identity stitch (mid-visit `identify`)
 *
 * Every persisted event carries an anonymous id, and `user_id` exists on the
 * `identify` event **alone** (ADR-0036: the collector never stamps it onto
 * later events), so a visitor who logs in mid-visit produces anonymous events
 * (partition `anonymous_id`) plus the identify row(s) (partition `user_id`) —
 * the identified partition overlapping the anonymous span rather than
 * following it. Partitioning by resolved identity alone would split that one
 * visit into two sessions and stamp a false bounce on the identified sliver —
 * and the sites that call `identify` are exactly the ones this hits. §10's key ("site + scoped client-session /
 * resolved identity + event ordering") wants continuity here, so after the
 * bridge a **stitch** re-joins an all-anonymous session onto the adjacent
 * identified session when
 *
 *   1. the anonymous session precedes the identified one within the inactivity
 *      window (same or an adjacent UTC date), and
 *   2. the identified session's own events carry an anonymous id the anonymous
 *      session also carries — the `identify` event carries *both* ids, so the
 *      linkage is proven by the events themselves.
 *
 * Because the linkage is in the data already, the stitch creates no new privacy
 * linkage (unlike the midnight bridge) and needs no hint. Two different logged-in
 * users on one shared device never share a `user_id`, so they never stitch to
 * each other — an anonymous span joins only the identified session that actually
 * continues it. A stitched session's resolved identity is the `user_id` (the
 * visitor *is* that user for the whole visit) and it is flagged `identityStitched`.
 *
 * ### `session_id` stability, and why the finalizer needs retraction
 *
 * The canonical `session_id` is a hash of `(site, earliest event id)` — stable
 * against a *late later* event (the earliest event does not change), which is
 * what keeps a late pageview flipping a bounce on the *same* id. It is **not**
 * stable in two cases the finalizer must handle, not the sessionizer: (a) a late
 * *earlier* event (an offline flush older than the current first) changes the
 * earliest event and mints a new id; (b) the bridge or stitch merges two spans a
 * prior finalizer run already wrote under two ids, so one id survives and the
 * other must disappear. In both, a stale id's last version would otherwise linger
 * as "current" and double-count a finalized range. `session_facts_versions`
 * carries a `retracted` flag for exactly this: the finalizer writes a
 * higher-version `retracted = 1` tombstone for any stored id absent from the
 * recompute, and readers filter `retracted = 0` *after* the latest-version
 * selection (migration 0013 documents the read pattern and its trap). The pure
 * sessionizer only produces the current session set; retraction is Checkpoint B.
 *
 * ### Meaningful activity
 *
 * Only these event types are **activity** — they reset the 30-minute timer and
 * bound the session:
 *
 *   - `page_view` — the primary signal.
 *   - `custom_event`, `conversion` — deliberate interactions.
 *   - `engagement` — the active-time beacon; it is where the "≥10s active"
 *     engaged signal comes from, so it must count as activity.
 *   - `identify` — a real client action (a login); it keeps a session alive but
 *     is not on its own an "engaged" signal.
 *
 * `web_vital` and `interaction` are **passive** and excluded from sessionization
 * entirely: a web vital fires automatically (not a visitor action) and a heatmap
 * interaction is *sampled* (`interaction_sampling`), so letting either move a
 * session boundary would make sessions depend on automation or on a sampling
 * fraction. They still feed their own rollups from `events_raw`; they do not
 * anchor a session here. `heartbeat` never reaches this layer at all — it is
 * realtime-only and is never persisted (contract `REALTIME_EVENT_TYPES`).
