/**
 * The acquisition source a `?ref=` tag on the landing URL names (ADR-0077).
 *
 * ## The problem this solves
 *
 * `?ref=producthunt` is the convention the directory-and-newsletter ecosystem
 * settled on: Product Hunt appends it to every outbound link, and so do the
 * dozens of smaller launch boards, self-hosting newsletters and design galleries
 * that send a young product its first traffic. The tag survives to us — `ref` is
 * in `ATTRIBUTION_QUERY_KEYS`, so the redactor keeps it — and until this module
 * existed **nothing read it**, so those visits were stored with
 * `referrer_domain = ''` and reported as Direct.
 *
 * Measured on production over 30 days: **11,787 events carried a `ref`, and
 * 11,035 of them (93.6%) had neither a referrer nor a `utm_source`** — every one
 * of them Direct. The tag was the only surviving evidence of where they came
 * from, and it was sitting in a column we already store.
 *
 * ## Why a label may become a host, and why that is not a guess
 *
 * `referrer_domain` is a **grouping key** (ADR-0028): one source must have one
 * spelling or one acquisition channel becomes two rollup rows that no reader can
 * merge back, and the rollups are additive and never rewritten. A `ref` value is
 * not a host — it is whatever the linking site chose to write — so it has to be
 * resolved to the spelling the rest of the pipeline uses.
 *
 * Production answered how, because the two populations overlap. When a `ref` tag
 * arrives on a visit whose referrer **did** survive, the referrer says what the
 * label meant (90 days, bare labels only):
 *
 * | `ref=`        | referrer beside it | events |
 * | ------------- | ------------------ | ------ |
 * | `producthunt` | `producthunt.com`  | 396    |
 * | `bharathunt`  | `bharathunt.org`   | 8      |
 * | `peerlist`    | `peerlist.io`      | 6      |
 *
 * So `REF_SOURCE_ALIASES` below is **seeded from measurement rather than from taste**, and
 * the guess a naive implementation would make is exactly the one the data
 * refutes: appending `.com` would have filed Peerlist and BharatHunt under hosts
 * that are not theirs. A label with no measured host therefore keeps **itself**
 * as the key — see `refSourceOf` — rather than being decorated into a domain
 * nobody verified.
 *
 * ## What it does not do
 *
 * It never overrides a referrer the browser actually sent, and never fills a
 * self-referral: an internal navigation whose URL kept the landing page's `?ref`
 * is not a second acquisition. Both guards live in the collector, on the one line
 * that decides (`apps/collector/src/events.ts`), because they are the same guards
 * `clickIdSourceOf` is called behind.
 */

/**
 * Bare `ref` labels whose host production has actually seen beside them.
 *
 * Two kinds of entry, and the bar for each is stated so a future addition is a
 * decision rather than a habit:
 *
 * - **Measured** — the label and the host co-occurred on real visits (the table
 *   in the module header). The threshold is five co-occurring events, which is
 *   the difference between "this label means this site" and one visitor who
 *   arrived through an aggregator that syndicates the link.
 * - **Household names a customer types by hand.** `?ref=twitter` is what a
 *   person writes on their own link, and the docs page tells them to; mapping it
 *   onto `x.com` puts their tagged traffic in the same row as the referrals X
 *   still reports itself, which is the whole point of a grouping key.
 *
 * Every value is written in canonical form already, and `refSourceOf` puts it
 * through `canonicalReferrerHost` anyway — the call is the guard that keeps this
 * table honest, not a transformation anyone relies on. A test pins it.
 *
 * Adding an entry later is a data change that affects **new data only** (D-R4):
 * rows already written keep the key they were written with, so a late addition
 * shows as a step, never as a rewrite.
