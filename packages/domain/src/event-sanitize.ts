/**
 * The property keys whose whole purpose is to carry an opaque provider id, and

 *
 * One key, and it is not a convenience. `order_id` is the documented property of
 * the `conversion` event (event catalog, "Revenue matching"; ADR-0033 D6 signal
 * 1): the customer fires `oa.conversion('purchase', { order_id })` on their
 * success page with a Stripe Checkout Session, PaymentIntent or charge id, and
 * the attribution matcher joins that value against the revenue fact. **Every
 * real Stripe id trips `looksLikeOpaqueToken`** -- `pi_...` is 27 characters,
 * `ch_...` 27, `cs_test_...` 38, all mixed alphanumerics with no spaces -- so
 * the generic rule stored `[redacted]` and the documented recipe could never
 * match anything. It was found in production rather than in CI, because every
 * fixture used a short synthetic id, which is exactly the length the rule
 * ignores.
 *
 * The exemption is as narrow as it can be made:
 *
 * - **one key**, matched case-insensitively, with nothing inferred from a
 *   substring -- `internal_order_id` is not exempt, because the convention this
 *   serves names one property and a fuzzy match would quietly widen it;
 * - **the explicit rules still run.** A value that is a known secret by shape
 *   (`sk_`/`rk_`/`whsec_`/a JWT/a `Bearer` header), an email address, or a long
 *   digit run is redacted under this key exactly as under any other. What is
 *   lifted is only "this is long and mixed-case, so it might be a token";
 * - **bounded length.** Above `OPAQUE_ID_MAX_LENGTH` the generic rule applies
 *   again. A provider id is tens of characters, and a thousand-character value
 *   under this key is not an order id -- the exemption must not be a hole
 *   somebody can post a document through.
 *
 * It also re-aligns the two halves of the pipeline: the tracker's own
 * client-side `redactText` has never had an opaque-token rule, so until now the
 * browser sent the real id and the collector destroyed it on arrival.
 *
 * **The same list carries a second rule (ADR-0064 D4a).** A key is exempt here
 * *because* its value is a provider id that ties a visitor to a record on the
 * provider's side — which is precisely what makes it a linking hint, so
 * `stripLinkingHints` reads this list rather than declaring a second one that
 * would drift from it. The tracker's `LINKING_HINT_PROPERTY_KEYS`
 * (`apps/tracker/src/privacy.ts`) is the one unavoidable copy: that package is
 * dependency-free by design and cannot import this one, so the two are pinned
 * equal by a test instead (`tests/tracker/privacy.test.ts`). Should a key ever
 * need one role without the other, split the list at that moment and not
 * before — two lists that are always equal are one list with two chances to be
 * edited badly.
