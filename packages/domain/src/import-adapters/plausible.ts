/**
 * The Plausible import adapter (ADR-0032, D2/D11; provider facts verified
 * 2026-07-29 against plausible.io/docs/csv-import).
 *
 * Plausible's export is a ZIP of **ten daily-aggregate CSVs** named
 * `imported_{table}_{YYYYMMDD}_{YYYYMMDD}.csv`, where the two dates are the range
 * the export was taken over. There are no event rows and no visitor identifiers
 * anywhere in it, which is the whole reason the read path unions rather than
 * merges (D2b) and the reason a cross-boundary number can never be `exact` (D5).
 *
 * Eight of the ten fill a staged report. `imported_entry_pages` and
 * `imported_exit_pages` are **declared dropped** — recognised, accepted, and
 * recorded as a summary note rather than failing the archive — because no live
 * entry/exit-pages operation exists to read them and a staging table nothing
 * serves would only widen the deletion registry for free.
 *
 * Three provider behaviours shape the parser and are worth naming, because each
 * one is a decision a future adapter has to make too:
 *
 * 1. **Column order is not part of the contract.** The header row is parsed and
 *    every column is addressed by name, so a provider that reorders or appends a
 *    column does not silently shift every value one place left. An unknown extra
 *    column is ignored with a counted warning; a missing *required* one fails the
 *    entry, because a report parsed with a column missing would stage zeros that
 *    look like measurements.
 * 2. **Fields are RFC 4180 quoted.** A page path or a UTM value legitimately
 *    contains a comma, so a `split(',')` would shear rows apart. The parser
 *    below handles quoting and doubled quotes in-line.
 * 3. **The city column cannot be honoured.** Plausible ships city as a GeoNames
 *    numeric id, and nothing in this system resolves that id to the name the live
 *    geography dimension uses (GeoLite2 resolves IP addresses, not GeoNames ids).
 *    The column is dropped and the reviewer is told exactly once, with a count.
 *
 * And one thing that is not about parsing at all: **the dimension values are
 * translated into this system's own vocabulary, not stored as the provider
 * spells them.** Plausible writes `Desktop`, `Chrome`, `macOS`, `www.google.com`;
 * the live classifier emits `desktop`, `chrome`, `macos`, `google.com`
 * (`anonymous-identity.ts`, `referrer.ts`). Staging the provider's spelling
 * would put two rows on every merged breakdown — one for each side of the
 * cutover — that a customer would read as two different browsers. The maps below
 * are the translation, and they are explicit rather than a blanket `toLowerCase`
 * because `macOS → macos` and `GNU/Linux → linux` are not case changes.

 * choice on purpose: a parser that skipped unreadable rows would publish a
 * dashboard quietly missing whatever it could not read, and the customer's only
 * signal would be numbers that are slightly too small.
 *
 * Two shapes reach it:
 *
 * - **A quoted field with no closing quote**, which is what a value containing a
 *   literal newline looks like from here: the pipeline hands entries over one
 *   line at a time (it is inflating as the adapter consumes, and materialising an
 *   entry would defeat the whole budgeted-streaming design), so the record's
 *   second half arrives as a separate, unrelated line. **A quoted field
 *   containing a newline therefore fails the run** — a real limitation, and a
 *   theoretical one for this provider: Plausible-generated exports percent-encode
 *   URLs and carry no newline inside any dimension value. A provider that does
 *   would need the framework to frame *records* rather than lines, which is a
 *   change to the pipeline, not to an adapter.
 * - **A quote that opens somewhere other than the start of a field** — ` "a,b",c`
 *   with a leading space. Read leniently that is four cells and read strictly it
 *   is three, and the two disagree about where every later value goes. Refusing
 *   is the only reading that cannot silently shear a row.
