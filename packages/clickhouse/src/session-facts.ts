/**
 * The session finalizer's ClickHouse surface (docs snapshot 02 §10, §15, 05
 * D-211; migrations 0013 and 0014). Milestone 8 Checkpoint B.
 *
 * The finalizer never re-implements session logic — it drives the pure
 * `sessionize` from @openanalytics/domain — so this module is only the reads and
 * writes that recompute needs:
 *
 *   - read the raw events of a recompute window from `events_raw` (bucketed on
 *     occurred_at, D-015) and hand them to the sessionizer;
 *   - read the current (latest-version) stored facts of that window, so a run can
 *     tell a changed session from an unchanged one and a vanished id from a live
 *     one;
 *   - insert new fact versions and retraction tombstones under a stable,
 *     content-derived deduplication token;
 *   - recompute an affected rollup bucket from the current non-retracted facts
 *     and swap it in at a higher generation.
 *
 * Every read that selects "the current truth" does it the way migrations 0013
 * and 0014 mandate: argMax over version/generation per key, THEN filter
 * `retracted = 0` — never a pre-filter, never FINAL. Aggregated columns are
 * qualified through the table alias, because CI's ClickHouse resolves a bare
 * name that an alias shadows to the alias and throws ILLEGAL_AGGREGATION.
 *
 * Runs on the `oa_ingest` credential, which ADR-0005 already widened to
 * `SELECT ON analytics.*` beside its `INSERT ON analytics.*`; no new secret.
