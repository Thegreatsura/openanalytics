/**

 *
 * ## The hole this fills
 *
 * There were exactly two ways out of `processing`, `markOutboxDelivered` and
 * `markOutboxFailed`, and BOTH require the claiming process to still be alive.
 * A worker that died between the claim and the settle left its row in
 * `processing` **forever**: no timeout, no lease, no sweeper. On 2026-08-22 the
 * worker died 111 times in an out-of-memory loop and five emails — three of
 * them sign-in links — were stranded there for two days, invisible to every
 * alert because only `pending` and `dead` were watched.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT scoped to a topic. Every drain in the process shares this
 * defect, including `realtime.access_revoked`, which has its own loop and no
 * sweeper of its own; a topic filter would fix the caller's topic and leave the
 * others exactly as they were.
 *
 * ## Why a row can go straight to `dead`
 *
 * A row whose attempts are already spent is not returned to `pending`, because
 * a payload that kills the worker WOULD be re-claimed, kill it again, and be
 * re-claimed — a reclaim loop built out of the crash-recovery mechanism. It is
 * settled `dead` instead, which is terminal, worth alerting on by count, and
 * the same verdict `markOutboxFailed` reaches for the same `attempts`. The one thing this must never do is leave a row in
 * `processing` that nothing will ever touch again — that is the bug, not the
 * fix.
 *
 * ## At-least-once, and what pays for it
 *
 * A reclaim cannot distinguish "died before sending" from "sent, then died
 * before recording it", so it must assume the first. The second is covered one
 * layer up: `processEmailOutbox` passes the row id to the transport as an
 * idempotency key, and Resend deduplicates on it for 24 hours — far outside
 * this five-minute lease. See `packages/integrations/src/email.ts`.

 * ## `available_at`, not `created_at`: lateness rather than age
 *
 * This measured `created_at` until it was found to cry wolf, and the difference
 * is the difference between "this row exists" and "this row is late". Some rows
 * are *written today to be sent next week* — a scheduled notice with an
 * `available_at` days out — and under `created_at` such a row was born already
 * violating a fifteen-minute stall threshold. That is not a hypothetical: one
 * reminder enqueued a day before its due time held the stalled alert open from
 * the moment it was written, and resolved itself when its due time arrived and
 * the drain sent it. An alert that fires because a scheduled thing is scheduled
 * teaches an operator to close it unread.
 *
 * The failures this still catches, which is why the change is safe:
 *
 *   * A row nothing is claiming. Its `available_at` is in the past and recedes
 *     further every second — exactly the shape `created_at` had.
 *   * A row stuck in `processing`. `claimDueOutbox` does not touch
 *     `available_at` when it claims, so the age of a row whose worker died goes
 *     on growing from when it first became due.
 *
 * The one case it deliberately stops catching is a row in its retry backoff:
 * `markOutboxFailed` pushes `available_at` a minute out, so a retrying row now
 * reports a small (or negative) lateness instead of an ever-growing age. That
 * failure is covered better elsewhere — five attempts take it to `dead` in
 * about five minutes, and the signal worth watching there is the COUNT of dead
 * rows, not any age. Trading a duplicate signal for the removal of a standing
 * false positive is the whole of this decision.
 *
 * `processing` is included because a claimed row whose worker died stays in that
 * state until `reclaimStalledOutbox` above returns it — and it is the status a
 * five-minute lease still leaves a five-minute window on, so it stays watched.
