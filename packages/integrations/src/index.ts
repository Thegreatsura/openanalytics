/**
 * External provider adapters.

 * Milestone 0 fixes the boundary only. Stripe billing arrives in Milestone 3,
 * import providers in Milestone 11 and revenue providers in Milestone 12.
 *
 * Two rules hold for every adapter added here:
 *
 * - A provider failure is never flattened into an empty result. Legacy returned
 *   `[]` on error, so the dashboard showed a confident "0 revenue" for an
 *   outage (docs snapshot 01 §12.3). Adapters return an explicit outcome and the
 *   read layer reports `degraded`/`unavailable` with a last-successful-sync time.
 * - Providers are registered, not branched on. The revenue provider list grows
 *   through a registry rather than through `if/else` inside domain code
 *   (docs snapshot 02 §14).
