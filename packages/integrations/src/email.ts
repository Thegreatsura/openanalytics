/**
 * Transactional email transport.
 *
 * G-007 closed the provider to Resend, but the provider stays behind this
 * adapter so a change does not reach domain code. Two rules from the wider
 * design apply here:
 *
 * - Every send goes through the outbox (docs snapshot 02 §6). This module only
 *   *delivers* a message; the auth flow enqueues it. Nothing calls a transport
 *   directly on a request path.
 * - No raw recipient in logs (docs snapshot 02 §26). The log transport records a
 *   subject and the recipient's domain, never the full address.
 *
 * When no transport is configured the log transport is used, and that is the
 * default in tests (plan Milestone 2 item 2).
 *
 * ## Three transports, one seam
 *
 * Resend is what our own deployment runs, and it is not what a self-hosted
 * deployment can run: it needs an account, a verified domain and a key. Until
 * SMTP existed here, the only door into a fresh install — the magic link — had
 * nowhere to be delivered, so nobody could sign in at all. SMTP is the
 * lowest-common-denominator transport every mail host on earth speaks, so it is
 * the one that makes the product installable.
 *
 * `selectEmailTransport` prefers Resend when both are configured. That is the
 * conservative direction: our deployment sets `RESEND_API_KEY` and no SMTP
 * block, and a stray `SMTP_HOST` in a worker env must not silently reroute
 * production mail through a host nobody meant to send from.
