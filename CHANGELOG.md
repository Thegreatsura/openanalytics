# Changelog

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the numbers mean what [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) says they mean: while
the major is `0`, a minor is anything you might have to read this file before
taking.

Releases before 0.6.0 have their notes on the
[GitHub releases page](https://github.com/OpenLabs-so/openanalytics/releases).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Five share posters.** The share button's poster is no longer only the
  overview: sources, countries, the people on the site right now and the top
  pages each have one, picked at the top of the preview, on the same card and
  in the same two themes. Each card hands the poster the rows it is showing,
  so the picture never disagrees with the screen. The site's name and its icon
  are separate switches; a list can drop its figures, its summary line or, on
  pages, its rank numbers.
- **Sharing from the poster.** Share copies the image and turns into X,
  Bluesky and LinkedIn, each opening a composer with a sentence about the
  poster; on a phone the system share sheet carries the image itself. `S`
  opens the share dialog from the overview.
- **AI referrals.** A card on the overview for the visits AI assistants
  send: ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini, Copilot and the rest, one row
  each, with their share of all visitors beside the title and the total in
  See all. A visit counts when the assistant is its referrer, or, when it
  arrived with no referrer at all, when the utm tag the assistant added names
  it, which is how a click from the ChatGPT apps is counted rather than
  filed under Direct. The public share board has the same card.
- **Browsers, OS and Devices in one card.** The three cuts of the devices
  read share one card with a picker in its header, and Devices keeps its
  filter door. The freed slot is where AI referrals sits.

### Changed

- The poster's chart is drawn on a smooth curve with the dashboard's own glow,
  and the two brands no longer share one line: the site is the headline, the
  period sits in the corner, and Open Analytics signs on a small tab at the
  bottom edge. The dark poster is the tab bar's charcoal rather than black.
- The public share board folds Browsers and OS into one card with a picker,
  keeps Devices as its own card, and wears the dashboard's own live badge
  beside its heading.

### Fixed

- The add-site dialog no longer grows a beat after opening.
- **Sources rows are ranked by the number they show.** Referrers and the utm
  cuts were ordered by pageviews underneath while printing visitors, so a
  list could read 27, 2, 27, 18. They are ordered by visitors now, on the
  card, in See all, on the public board and on the poster.
- **Top pages reads in order.** The pages read ranks by views and the card
  shows visitors; when the gateway returns the whole set, the card now orders
  it by visitors. A capped set keeps the server's order until the server can
  rank by visitors.
- **The Coolify and Dokploy blueprints pin `v0.6.0`.** Both went out with the
  0.6.0 release still pinning the `v0.5.0` images, so a platform install of
  this release ran the previous one. `RELEASING.md` now lists every pin a
  release has to move.
- **Why every country can be Unknown, written down.** `SELF-HOSTING.md` still
  said the Coolify geo volume stays empty until you fill it, which stopped
  being true in 0.4.2. And no guide said that a visitor arriving over IPv6
  reaches the collector as the Docker bridge gateway and so gets no country;
  the troubleshooting section and both platform guides now do.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-05

**Upgrade notes: none.** `./upgrade.sh` and nothing else. The two ClickHouse
migrations in this release only add columns, and the migrate container applies
them while the upgrade runs.

### Added

- **Filters.** Clicking a row in Sources, Locations or the device cards keeps
  only the sessions that match it, and the overview re-reads with that filter
  applied. Four dimensions — source, country, city, device — combined with
  `and` across dimensions and `or` within one. What you picked shows as marks
  on the tab bar, each clearing on its own. A filtered view is rebuilt from raw
  events rather than read off a rollup, so it covers at most 92 days; past that
  the cards offer to shorten the range or drop the filters. The same grammar
  serves the dashboard, `/v1/read` and MCP, so they cannot drift.
- **Entries and exits.** Top Pages carries entrances, exits and a bounce rate
  per path, and can be ranked by any of them. The ranking is a question put to
  the server rather than a re-sort of the rows on screen.
- **Click ids as sources.** `gclid`, `fbclid`, `msclkid` and their companions
  name the ad network a visit came from when the referrer does not.
- **`?ref=` names a source.** A link you control can carry `?ref=twitter` or
  `?ref=newsletter`, and visits that would have read as Direct get that name
  instead. Known names fold onto the site they mean; anything else is kept as
  written. A referrer the browser did send always wins.
- **Polar as a revenue provider.** A second provider a site can connect
  alongside Stripe, with Standard Webhooks signature verification.
- **Umami import.** An adapter for Umami exports, and one archive entry may now
  fill several reports.
- **Overview poster.** A share button turns the numbers on screen into an
  image — the site's mark, the period, the headline figures and the traffic
  curve — as a PNG or on the clipboard. It draws from what the board already
  has, so it cannot disagree with the screen it was made from.
- **Realtime names who is here.** The overview's realtime card lists the
  visitors present rather than the paths that are busy, and a live badge sits
  beside the Overview and Realtime titles.
- **MCP hints.** Every tool spells out its hints, native-app redirect URIs are
  accepted, and a root `.mcp.json` points at the hosted server.
- **Dokploy.** The blueprint ships with an import config and a copyable raw
  link beside it.
- Documentation for the dashboard: what each headline metric counts, what each
  breakdown is a cut of, how filters behave, and how to tag your own links.

### Changed

- **The tracker stands down for a site that is gone.** A `404` from the config
  read is a gone-marker, and `collection_paused` carries a body and an ETag;
  the tracker obeys both and stops asking.
- Squircle cards fall back to rounder corners on engines without
  `corner-shape`, and to a plain radius where even that is unsupported.

### Fixed

- **Email.** A rate limit is retryable and a bad address is not, so a `429` no
  longer burns an address; a stranger's typo no longer becomes a page. A
  terminal failure is recorded as `failed`.
- **Ingest.** The finalizer window is bounded, the outbox is leased and
  reclaimed rather than raced, the backlog carries an `available_at`, and the
  queue publishes its own metrics.
- **Realtime.** A refusal is believed only once a fresh token has been refused
  too, so an expired token no longer reads as a revoked one.
- **Shared reports.** Percentages are shares of the total rather than of the
  biggest row.

### Coming in 0.7.0

Fifteen-minute rollups, which serve every timezone including the half- and
quarter-hour ones (+05:30, +05:45), with a one-time backfill the upgrader runs
for you.
