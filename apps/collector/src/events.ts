 * The rule this route exists to keep is one sentence long: **202 only after the
 * durable queue write succeeded.** Legacy swallowed store errors and answered
 * 200 for events it had not stored (docs snapshot 01 §4.3), and every structural
 * choice below is a way of making that impossible here rather than merely
 * avoided:
 *
 * - The queue call is the last thing that happens before the response. Nothing
 *   after it can turn a failure into a success.
 * - A queue failure is a `503` with `Retry-After`, and it is thrown, so there is
 *   no path that falls through to the 202.
 * - Everything with its own failure mode — the realtime update, the usage
 *   counter — happens *after* the queue write and cannot fail the request
 *   (§7.2). A realtime outage must not lose an accepted historical event.
 *
 * And the batch is atomic: validation runs over the whole batch first, and the
 * enqueue is one script, so an invalid event or an idempotency conflict leaves
 * nothing enqueued (§7.3).
