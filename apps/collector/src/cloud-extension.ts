/**
 * The seam the hosted quota and suspension gates mount through.
 *
 * The registration shape the rest of the split uses, applied to ingest. Three
 * gates were inline in `events.ts` and `ingest-gate.ts` until the open-core
 * split, and all three are about money: whether a `suspended` site is inside its
 * paid grace window, whether the plan's window limit is spent, and the near-
 * realtime counter that decides both. A self-hosted collector has no plan and no
 * window, and — this is the part worth stating — **it must not have a quota gate
 * that fails open**. Absent an extension there is no gate at all rather than one
 * that always says yes: the difference matters the day somebody reads this code
 * to find out what limits their install has.
 *
 * `apps/collector/src/main.cloud.ts` is the entry point that registers one; the
 * product's `main.ts` reads the registry and names no cloud module, which is what
 * `scripts/check-boundaries.mjs` enforces.
