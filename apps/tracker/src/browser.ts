/**
 * Bundle entry point.
 *
 * The only file that touches ambient globals. It reads its options from the
 * `<script>` tag, installs the tracker (without stealing a namespace it does not
 * own) and then, asynchronously, folds in the site's cached configuration.
 *
 * Configuration arrives after the first pageview on purpose: a pageview that
 * waited for a config round-trip would be lost on every fast bounce, which is
 * exactly the visit an analytics product must not miss.
 *
 * This file is also where the tracker gets its *transport*. `createTracker`
 * takes `fetchImpl`/`beaconImpl` as injected capabilities — that is what makes
 * the runtime testable — and `optionsFromScript` cannot supply them: it reads
 * `data-` attributes, and a DOM attribute is not a function. So they are
 * feature-detected off the real `window` here, at the one call site that is
 * allowed to know what a browser is. Without them `createTransport` has neither
 * implementation, every batch takes its `no_transport` requeue branch and
 * `sendBeacon` falls through to the same place: the tracker installs, collects,
 * queues — and never sends a byte (ADR-0019 open item 1).
 *
 * `beaconImpl` is handed a *string*, never a `Blob`. A string body makes the
 * browser stamp the beacon `text/plain;charset=UTF-8`, which is exactly
 * `INGEST_CONTENT_TYPE` and exactly what keeps the POST a CORS *simple* request
 * with no preflight (transport.ts). A `Blob` would let us set any type — and any
 * type we set that is not one of the three safelisted ones costs a preflight on
 * every batch, on a request the page is unloading out from under.
 *
 * Both detections are independent on purpose: a browser without `sendBeacon`
 * still delivers through `fetch` (the transport falls back), and a browser
 * without `fetch` still delivers the unload flush through `sendBeacon`.
