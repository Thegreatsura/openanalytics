 * Tracker configuration fetch (docs snapshot 02 §11).
 *
 * The response is public, cacheable and version-stamped. Two caches sit in front
 * of it: the CDN's, keyed by `ETag`, and this one in `localStorage`. Inside the
 * soft TTL the tracker makes no request at all; after it, the request is a
 * conditional `If-None-Match`, so the common answer is a 304 with no body.
 *
 * The tracking key is a query parameter here because a `<script>`-driven GET has
 * nowhere else to put it. It stays write-only: this endpoint returns
 * configuration, never data, and the response carries no credential of any kind.
 *
 * A failed or malformed config is never fatal — the tracker keeps its defaults.

 * It was six hours, which made this a second and much longer staleness layer
 * stacked on the HTTP cache: a rule published in the dashboard reached an
 * already-cached browser up to six hours later, and a publish a customer cannot
 * observe is not a publish. At five minutes the `localStorage` copy is what it
 * is actually useful as — a de-dupe across rapid page loads — and the worst case
 * from Publish to a browser evaluating the rule is the ~600 s D4 states.
 *
 * The cost is at most one conditional `GET` per visitor per five minutes,
 * answered `304` with no body. A session shorter than five minutes — most of
 * them — makes no extra request at all.

 * A 404 there has exactly one meaning — no live site matches the key: the site
 * was deleted, or its tracking key was expired by an operator block. Unknown,
 * revoked and expired are deliberately indistinguishable on the wire, and the
 * tracker needs no distinction either: in every one of those states each event
 * it sends will be refused, so sending is only load. The first large blocked
 * customer kept ~66 requests/second of refused batches coming for days, enough
 * to OOM the edge proxy — the fix is that the tracker itself stands down.
 *
 * One hour, matching the `oa.js` asset cache: after a block, a visitor costs at
 * most one config probe per hour instead of a batch per pageview. Kept finite so
 * a site that comes back — a key rotation, an unblock, a config-store blip that
 * answered 404 for a moment — resumes within the hour on its own.
