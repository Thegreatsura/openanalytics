/**
 * The generic outbox dispatcher.
 *
 * Every outbox topic needs a consumer, and three did not have one:
 * `billing.subscription`, `site.ownership_changed` and `notification.rapid_burn`
 * were written in-transaction by producers that were correct, and then
 * accumulated as `pending` rows forever. An outbox nobody drains is not a
 * deferred side effect — it is a side effect that never happens, plus a table
 * that grows without bound and a `SKIP LOCKED` scan that gets slower every day.
 *
 * `email-drain.ts` and `realtime-revocation-drain.ts` each hand-rolled the same
 * claim/deliver/fail loop around one topic. This is that loop with the topic
 * lifted into a registry, so a new topic costs a handler rather than a file —
 * which is what M10 needs, since deletion fans out across several of them.
 *
 * The handlers registered here are deliberately minimal: they record that the
 * effect was observed and settle the row. That is not a placeholder for its own
 * sake — the *state changes* behind all three topics are already durable and
 * already audited at the point they were written (an entitlement change, an
 * ownership cutover, a burn threshold crossing), so what the outbox row buys is
 * fan-out: cache invalidation, notification, digest. M10 owns that fan-out. What
 * this stops today is the pile-up, and it means the fan-out arrives as a handler
 * body rather than as a new drain.
 *
 * Two drains are deliberately NOT folded in. `email.send` and
 * `realtime.access_revoked` carry transport dependencies (Resend, the realtime
 * cache) whose absence must not stop the others, and both are proven by their own
 * suites; merging them would be churn on working paths.
