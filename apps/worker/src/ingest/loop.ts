/**
 * The consumer loop (docs snapshot 02 §7.4/§7.5).
 *
 * One iteration does three things, in this order and for this reason:
 *
 * 1. **Recover.** Manifests left behind by a crashed worker are finished before
 *    anything new is read. A batch already holding a lease on stream messages
 *    blocks nothing else, but its events are the oldest in the system and
 *    freshness is measured from acceptance.
 * 2. **Reclaim.** Pending messages idle longer than a healthy worker would ever
 *    hold them are claimed. This is what makes a dead worker's un-manifested
 *    messages someone else's problem rather than nobody's.
 * 3. **Read.** New messages are accumulated into the open batch until the flush
 *    rule closes it.
 *
 * Shutdown drains rather than abandons: `stop()` sets the flag, the open batch
 * flushes on the `shutdown` trigger, and the loop exits after the in-flight
 * batch reaches a decided state (02 §7.5).
