/**
 * The `import_prepare` executor (ADR-0032, D6/D7).
 *
 * Download, validate, stage — and then **terminate succeeded at
 * `ready_for_review`**. The human review that follows can take days, and a job
 * that held its lease across it would occupy the site's live-job slot and be
 * repeatedly stolen and re-run by lease expiry. The run is the state machine;
 * this job is one push along it.
 *
 * ## Which failures end the run and which end the attempt
 *
 * This is the distinction the whole executor is organised around, because
 * getting it backwards produces one of two bad outcomes: a customer told their
 * archive is broken because ClickHouse was down, or a job retrying a customer's
 * malformed CSV a hundred times.
 *
 * - **`ImportRunFailure`** — the archive, or the run, is not something this
 *   system will import. The *run* is failed with a safe category, its staged
 *   rows are best-effort deleted, and the **job returns `succeeded`**: it did
 *   its work and the answer was no. Retrying would ask the same question of the
 *   same bytes.
 * - **Infrastructure** — storage unavailable, ClickHouse unreachable or refusing
 *   the insert, a resource the worker was not configured with. The job returns
 *   `retry` and the run is left exactly where it is, so the import resumes when
 *   the outage ends and nothing customer-visible changes.
 *
 * ## Resume
 *
 * A reclaimed lease re-enters here and re-parses from the beginning of the
 * archive. That is deliberate, and it is what makes the chunk tokens correct:
 * parsing is deterministic and the chunk size is the one **recorded on the run**
 * (never the current policy default), so chunk N of report R contains the same
 * rows on every attempt. Chunks below the recorded progress are re-parsed and
 * *not* re-inserted; the summary is recomputed from the full parse, so a resumed
 * run and a first-pass run produce the same summary. Re-parsing costs CPU over a
 * local file and buys a resume path whose entire durable state is one integer
 * per report.

 * **Every retry this executor returns counts against `JOB_MAX_ATTEMPTS`.**
 *
 * Unlike a deletion draining an ingest fence, nothing this job waits on ends by
 * itself: a missing ClickHouse grant, a bucket credential a deployment never
 * added, an endpoint that stays down. A non-counting retry over one of those is
 * an immortal job — and an immortal `import_prepare` is worse than a wasted
 * tick, because the run it is working stays in `validating`/`processing`, which
 * are inside the live-run unique's predicate (D3). The site can then start no
 * other import, ever, and no error is ever reported to the customer.
 *
 * Counting makes the guard fire, which settles the job `failed_terminal` and
 * runs `onTerminal` — the hook that fails the run and releases the slot.
 *
 * The lease-lost path is marked the same way and the marking is moot there: the
 * runner's write is guarded on `claimed_by`, so a worker whose lease was stolen
 * changes nothing at all. It is uniform on purpose, so that no later edit has to
 * re-derive which of these four returns was the safe one.

/**
 * The review payload — and the D4 interpretation this checkpoint implements.
 *
 * ADR-0032 D4 says rows at or after the cutover are "dropped at staging with a
 * summary warning". Taken literally that is not implementable in the order the
 * rest of the ADR requires: the cutover is **chosen at review time** (D4's own
 * first sentence) and its default depends on `max imported date`, which is not
 * known until staging has finished. Staging cannot drop rows against a boundary
 * that staging is what computes.
 *
 * What this implements instead, and it is the closest correct thing:
 *
 * - staging drops **nothing** by date, and stages every row the adapter emits;
 * - the summary records `proposed_cutover_date` (D4's default,
 *   `min(first live day, max imported date + 1)`) and a
 *   `rows_at_or_after_cutover` warning counting the rows that fall at or past
 *   it — which is exactly the warning D4 asks the reviewer to see;
 * - the **read path** is where the partition is enforced: the imported branch
 *   binds `date < cutover_date` (D4's own read rule), so an overlapping row is
 *   dead weight in ClickHouse and cannot reach a dashboard.
 *
 * The guarantee D4 actually wants — "the imported side cannot overlap live even
 * if a later query uses a different timezone" — is therefore held by the read
 * filter rather than by the absence of the rows, which is strictly stronger: it
 * survives a customer publishing with an *earlier* cutover than the default,
 * which dropping-at-staging would not. The cost is storage for rows nobody
 * reads, bounded by the overlap the warning counts and reclaimed with the run.
 *
 * ADR-0032 D4 carries this amendment (2026-07-29), so the decision record and
 * this function now say the same thing.
