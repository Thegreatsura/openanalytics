/**
 * The budgeted ZIP walker (ADR-0032, D6.3).
 *
 * The collector's `body.ts` pattern at file scale: every limit is enforced
 * **during** inflation rather than checked afterwards, so a hostile archive
 * fails with a category instead of an OOM. Nothing here trusts a number the
 * archive states about itself.
 *
 * ## Why this is hand-rolled and not a library
 *
 * The repository is dependency-averse — the Stripe adapter is SDK-free — and the
 * usual counter-argument, "security-sensitive parsing should not be hand-rolled
 * hubris", does not apply the way it looks like it does here. **The
 * decompression is not hand-rolled**: it is `node:zlib`'s `inflateRaw`, the same
 * battle-tested C library every ZIP package in the ecosystem also delegates to.
 * What this file implements is the *container* format — fixed-width little-
 * endian structs at known offsets — and a budget enforcer around the inflate
 * stream.
 *
 * That second half is the part a library would not have given us anyway. `yauzl`
 * (the mature, minimal, widely-used candidate) hands back a `Readable` per entry
 * and leaves every one of D6's budgets to the caller: per-entry uncompressed cap,
 * total uncompressed cap, per-row cap, and the decision to stop mid-inflate. So
 * adopting it would have replaced ~150 lines of struct reading with a
 * dependency, and left the security-critical code — the part that decides when
 * to stop reading a bomb — exactly where it is now. It would also have added a
 * transitive dependency to the *worker*, the process that holds the ClickHouse
 * ingest credential and the bucket keys.
 *
 * The correctness risk that argument leaves open is real and is answered by the
 * shape of the reader rather than by care:
 *
 * - **The central directory is the authority, not the local headers.** The
 *   directory is read first, in full, so the entry count is known and refused
 *   *before* a single byte is inflated. A reader that walked local headers
 *   forwards (which is what a "streaming ZIP reader" usually means) would have to
 *   start inflating to discover how many entries it was going to get.
 * - **Zip64 is refused, not partially supported.** Any sentinel value that means
 *   "the real number is in an extra field" ends the run. Half-implemented zip64
 *   is where container parsers get their offset-confusion bugs, and no export
 *   this system accepts can reach the 4 GiB / 65 535-entry boundary anyway:
 *   `IMPORT_MAX_ARCHIVE_BYTES` is 256 MiB and `IMPORT_MAX_ENTRIES` is 32.
 * - **Only stored and deflate are read.** Every other method — including the
 *   encrypted flag — is a refusal rather than a fallback.
 *
 * The zip64 refusal, the ratio bomb, the nested archive, the entry-count breach
 * and the oversize row each have a test that builds the archive byte by byte.
