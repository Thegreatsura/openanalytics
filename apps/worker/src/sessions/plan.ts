/**
 * The finalizer's pure planning core (docs snapshot 02 §10, §15, 05 D-211).
 * Milestone 8 Checkpoint B.
 *
 * Given the sessions the pure sessionizer recomputed for a window and the facts
 * currently stored for that window, this decides — with no clock of its own and
 * no I/O — exactly which fact rows to write:
 *
 *   - a **new version** for every recomputed session that differs from its
 *     stored latest (a late second pageview that flipped a bounce to engaged is
 *     the motivating case, D-211), and for a session that had been retracted and
 *     has reappeared;
 *   - a **retraction tombstone** for every stored, non-retracted session id that
 *     the recompute no longer produces (a re-key by a late earlier event, or a
 *     bridge/stitch merge — migration 0013's tombstone contract);
 *   - **nothing at all** for a session whose recompute is byte-identical to what
 *     is stored, which is what makes a re-run over an unchanged range a no-op and
 *     acceptance criterion 2 hold.
 *
 * The version is `max(stored version in the window) + 1`, shared by every row the
 * run writes — monotonic, and derived from stored state rather than a clock, so
 * two runs can never collide on a version through a timestamp race. The finalized
 * flag is set from the caller's `nowMs` against the inactivity + lateness
 * horizon; a session past it can never change again.
 *
 * The watermark this returns is `min(horizon, earliest provisional session
 * start)`, pulled back to a fixpoint so that no recomputed session's span
 * straddles it. The naive `min(...)` is unsafe on its own: the next recompute
 * window reads by `>= watermark`, so a session that overlaps the watermark in
 * wall-clock time would be split — its tail re-sessionized under a new id while
 * the stored original stays invisible to the diff — and duplicated. The
 * pull-back re-includes any overlapping (typically already finalized) session in
 * the next window, where it recomputes byte-identical and writes nothing.
