/**
 * The session finalizer (plan Milestone 8 items 2-4; docs snapshot 02 §10, §15,
 * 05 D-211). Milestone 8 Checkpoint B.
 *
 * One site, one run, and never any session logic of its own: it reads the raw
 * events of the recompute window, drives the pure `sessionize` from
 * @openanalytics/domain, and turns the diff between what that produces and what
 * is stored into versioned fact writes and a rollup swap. The order is the
 * guarantee — facts are made durable before the rollups that summarise them, and
 * the watermark advances only after both, so a crash at any point is recovered by
 * a re-run that recomputes the same window and finds nothing left to do.
 *
 *   1. **Claim.** A conditional lease (migration 0017); a site another worker
 *      holds is skipped.
 *   2. **Recompute.** Read `[watermark, now)` from `events_raw`, sessionize,
 *      read the stored facts of the same window.
 *   3. **Version.** Insert a strictly higher version for every changed session
 *      and a tombstone for every vanished one (finalized iff past the
 *      inactivity + lateness horizon).
 *   4. **Swap.** Recompute every affected hour/day bucket from the current
 *      non-retracted facts and insert it at a higher generation.
 *   5. **Advance.** Move the watermark to the earliest still-provisional session
 *      and release the lease.

/**
 * The most raw events one recompute window may read.
 *
 * There was no cap at all until 2026-08-24, and `readWindowEvents` read
 * `[watermark, infinity)`. That is fine while the watermark keeps moving and
 * vicious the moment it stops: a site sending a million events accumulates them
 * all into one window, the window is read into memory, the process dies, the
 * watermark therefore never advances, and the next run reads the same window
 * plus whatever arrived meanwhile. The worker spent ten hours in that loop on
 * 2026-08-22 — 111 restarts — against a site with 961,858 rows in its window.
 *
 * A ROW cap and not a TIME cap, which is the part worth stating plainly: a time
 * cap bounds how much clock the window covers, not how much memory it costs. A
 * customer sending a million events an hour blows through an hour-wide window
 * exactly as they blew through an unbounded one. Rows are the thing that is
 * actually allocated, so rows are the thing to bound.
 *
 * 200,000: 962k rows exhausted a 768 MB heap, so a fifth of that is roughly a
 * 300 MB peak with the limit left where it is. The number is derived from one
 * measurement, and `docker stats oa-worker` after deployment is what should
 * move it — not a second estimate.
