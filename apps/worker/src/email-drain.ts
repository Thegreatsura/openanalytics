/**
 * Email delivery is a worker job (docs snapshot 02 §5): the API only writes the
 * send to the outbox, and this loop drains it through whichever transport is
 * configured — Resend, SMTP, or the log transport when neither is.
 *
 * Since migration 0043 there are two places a transport can come from, and this
 * file is where they are reconciled. **A transport stored in the database wins
 * over the environment.** That direction is the one the operator expects: they
 * typed it into a screen a moment ago, they can see it, and they can change it
 * without a shell. An env file is set once and forgotten, and being unable to
 * override it from the product was the wall the self-host dry run kept hitting.
 * A deployment that wants the opposite sets `DEPLOYMENT_SETTINGS=disabled` and
 * this loop never reads the table at all.
 *
 * The stored transport is re-read each tick, so an operator who fixes a relay
 * sees the next queued message go out — no restart, which is the whole point.
 * The nodemailer client is still built once per *configuration*: the resolved
 * block is fingerprinted, and the transport is rebuilt only when the
 * fingerprint changes. Rebuilding per tick would re-run TLS negotiation every
 * five seconds for a setting that changes twice a year.
