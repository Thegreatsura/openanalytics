/**
 * Resolves a *revenue* request to its rollup pair and effective range
 * (ADR-0033, D7; ClickHouse migration 0018). Milestone 12 Checkpoint 5.
 *
 * `resolveSession` again, and deliberately so: the revenue rollups have exactly
 * the session rollups' shape — 1h and 1d only, no minute grain, versioned
 * generation swaps rather than an incremental view — so the grain decision is
 * the same decision. Three consequences follow, and each is the session rule
 * with money in it:
 *
 * - **A sub-hour timezone is refused.** There is no minute revenue rollup to
 *   fall back to, and a zone whose local midnight never lands on a UTC hour
 *   cannot be answered from hour buckets without misattributing the edge of
 *   every day. `RESOLUTION_NOT_AVAILABLE` rather than a plausible wrong total.
 * - **A minute-tier range is served at hour grain.** "Today" on a revenue chart
 *   is hourly, which is also the finest grain the money is meaningful at — a
 *   per-minute revenue series is noise around individual transactions, and the
 *   transactions list is the surface for those.
 * - **A non-UTC day is composed from the hour rollup**, so a DST 23/25-hour day
 *   sums the hours it actually had.
 *
 * The summary shares this resolver rather than having one of its own: a range
 * total is the same buckets without the `GROUP BY`, so a range the chart refuses
 * is a range the total would have to guess at.
