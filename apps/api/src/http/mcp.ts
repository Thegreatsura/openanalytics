/**
 * The MCP server (ADR-0043 D10; plan 04 §Milestone 16 item 3).
 *
 * **Plan item 3 — "typed tools use the same service, metric and cost-limit
 * layer" — is met structurally here, not asserted.** Every tool call is
 * translated into an ordinary `Request` against this same api's `/v1/read/*`
 * route and dispatched through it, carrying the caller's own `Authorization`
 * header. So the tool does not *resemble* the read path; it **is** the read
 * path:
 *
 * - the same `readAuth` resolves the credential and charges the same limiter
 *   under the same `oauth:<id>` key;
 * - the same `X-OA-Site` membership check runs, per request, against live
 *   membership;
 * - the same scope checks, the same billing gate, the same declared-range
 *   ceiling and the same `elapsed_ms` ledger apply;
 * - the same `AnalyticsService`, the same query gateway, the same `cache_epoch`
 *   and the same import pointer produce the numbers.
 *
 * The alternative — tools that call the service methods directly — would have
 * been a second path that *starts* identical and drifts the first time somebody
 * adds a middleware to one and not the other. A test drives a tool and the route
 * with one credential and compares the bodies; another spends the cost budget
 * through a tool and watches the route refuse. Neither would be possible to write
 * honestly against a parallel implementation.
 *
 * ## Why the protocol is hand-written
 *
 * `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is not a dependency of this repository, and the
 * part of MCP this server needs is three JSON-RPC methods over one POST —
 * `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`. That is framing, not cryptography.
 * It is the opposite of D9's reasoning about the authorization server, where the
 * parts worth not re-deriving were PKCE, code replay and token hashing; there is
 * no security-critical algorithm here, and adding a dependency to the api's
 * install path to avoid ~120 lines of dispatch would be the worse trade.
 *
 * ## Authentication
 *
 * An OAuth access token, and **it is verified here rather than only where a tool
 * dispatches**. The first version checked that an `Authorization` header was
 * merely *present* and left validation to the `/v1/read` route each tool calls —
 * so `initialize` and `tools/list` answered `200` to an expired or revoked
 * token, and the client learned nothing was wrong until every tool call failed.
 * Found by presenting a token that had just been withdrawn, during this
 * milestone's production proof.
 *
 * That is not a data leak — `tools/list` is a static catalogue — it is a
 * *protocol* defect, and the protocol is the point: RFC 9728's `401` plus
 * `WWW-Authenticate` is precisely the signal that makes a client re-authorize.
 * A `200` in its place is a client that never refreshes.
 *
 * **Private keys are not accepted here, deliberately.** This endpoint is an
 * OAuth 2.1 protected resource by definition; its metadata names an
 * authorization server, and `WWW-Authenticate` sends a caller there. A key
 * holder has `/v1/read` directly and needs no tool catalogue. Keeping the rule
 * "OAuth tokens only" means the pointer we hand out is always the right advice.

 * read route. The only thing that varies is what a model needs to be told, and
 * the argument gets stronger every time the table grows. How many rows there are
 * is deliberately not written here: the sentence that named a number went stale
 * inside one milestone and no test noticed. `tests/unit/mcp-write-tools.test.ts`
 * pins the roster as a literal list, which is the only place a count belongs.
 *
 * **Revenue's two aggregates are here since ADR-0049**, and they arrived the way
 * ADR-0046 D3 said they would have to: by a named one-decision ADR with a
 * privacy argument and a role story, not as two more entries somebody added
 * because the service method existed. What travels is `summary` and
 * `timeseries` — totals and buckets in the site's reporting currency, carrying
 * no per-customer dimension. What does not, and what ADR-0043 D15 still keeps
 * off this surface entirely, is `transactions` and its `journey`: an email, a
 * customer id, an order id. There is no row for them here because there is no
 * route for them there, which is the stronger of the two claims.
 *
 * The two revenue rows are safe to show every consumer of this table, including
 * an MCP host, and that is a property of the *route* rather than of the
 * catalogue: reaching it needs a credential carrying `revenue:read` **and** a
 * principal that resolves to an owner of the selected site (ADR-0043 D5's
 * intersection). Everyone the dashboard refuses is refused here, and the
 * refusal arrives as tool content the model has to read.
 *
 * Still deliberately **not** here: realtime. `/v1/read/realtime/token` mints a
 * *token*; a tool that hands a model a bearer credential is a category error
 * regardless of what the credential opens.
