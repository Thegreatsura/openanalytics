   * - **A failed read is still charged.** A query that times out or errors has
   *   already spent the time, and not charging it would make failure the cheapest

   *

  /**
   * A path under `/read/` that does not exist answers `404` — to an
   * authenticated caller.
   *
   * Without this it falls through to the business subtree's blanket session
   * guard and answers `401`, which AGENTS.md records as a general property of
   * `/v1` (ADR-0041 D3 met the same thing). On *this* surface that answer is
   * actively misleading: it tells a caller holding a perfectly good key to go
   * re-check it, which is the exact failure the `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` decision
   * above exists to avoid. `GET /v1/read/analytics/revenue` is not a permission
   * problem and not an authentication problem; it is a path that does not exist,
   * and the surfaces D4 excluded are the ones a caller will actually try.
   *
   * Registered last, so it catches only what the real routes did not, and it
   * sits *behind* `readKeyAuth` — an anonymous caller still gets `401` and
   * learns nothing about which paths exist.
