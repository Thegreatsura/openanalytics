 * interval picker; what is missing is the app, not the design: no site
 * switcher, no account, no See all, no connect doors.
 *
 * Eight surfaces now, each behind its own owner opt-in (ADR-0039): overview
 * totals, the traffic chart, session metrics, geography, pages, sources,
 * devices and the live count. **Each renders only if the owner shared it** —
 * a surface that was not shared answers 404, and that is an absence, not a
 * fault. No endpoint reports which surfaces are on, deliberately: such a list
 * would itself describe a site nobody chose to describe. So every surface is
 * read independently and folds itself away, and the board's shape is the
 * owner's choices rather than ours.
 *
 * The chart is the dashboard's own `OverviewChart` with its reader injected,
 * not a second implementation — a share link has no slug to resolve and no
 * session to resolve it with, but everything below the fetch is identical.
 *
 * Every failure (wrong slug, rotated link, disabled dashboard) is an
 * indistinguishable "not available" — existence is deliberately not revealed.
