 * the copy says "Continue with…" rather than promising one or the other.
 *
 * This is the original two-step card (pre-a4af585): the email panel hands off
 * to a "link sent" panel with a measured-height spring, and no password field
 * exists anywhere on it. The api half of the email path is
 * `/sign-in/magic-link`, served by the Better Auth `magicLink` plugin in
 * `packages/auth`. The copy promises a 15-minute expiry — the server pins that
 * with `MAGIC_LINK_EXPIRES_IN_SECONDS = 900`, and the two must move together.
 *
 * Two error vocabularies meet here and must not be conflated. A JSON call
 * fails with Better Auth's `{ code, message }` → `presentAuthError`. A
 * provider sign-in — and a dead or expired magic link — fails by *redirecting
 * back* with `?error=<code>` → `presentOAuthError`, read server-side by the
 * page. Neither is the `/v1` `ErrorEnvelope`.

                        hardware: there is no service on the other side of the
                        agreement, `/terms` and `/privacy` are marketing pages
                        that ship with the hosted product rather than with the
                        software, and a sentence promising terms behind a link
                        that answers 404 is worse than no sentence. What the
                        software actually does with visitor data is documented
                        at /docs/privacy, which is a description rather than a
                        contract. */}
