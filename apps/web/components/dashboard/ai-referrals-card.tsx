/**
 * The visits AI assistants sent, cut out of the same sources read the
 * Sources card folds (feature_candidates.md §1, built 2026-09-10). Those
 * rows were always in the Referrers list, wearing a favicon among every
 * other domain; this card gives the question its own place and its own
 * total.
 *
 * **Referrals, never citations.** A citation is the site being named inside
 * an answer, and it happens whether or not anybody clicks; a referral is
 * the click. Most readers of an assistant's answer never click, so a small
 * number here says nothing about how often the site is cited. The card is
 * named for what it can count.
 *
 * **How a tuple qualifies.** A sources row is the tuple referrer domain by
 * utm source, medium and campaign. It counts when its referrer is an
 * assistant, or, when it has no referrer at all, when the utm tag it carries
 * names one: ChatGPT appends `utm_source=chatgpt.com` to every link it hands
 * out, Claude appends `utm_source=Claude AI` with `utm_medium=claude.ai`,
 * and a click from their apps arrives with the tag and an empty referrer, so
 * it would otherwise sit under Direct. That is why the Referrers list can
 * show one ChatGPT visit on a day the UTM sources list shows two. Each tuple
 * is counted once, under whichever of the two named it; a tuple whose
 * referrer is some other site keeps that referrer even if its tag says
 * ChatGPT, because the click happened there.
 *
 * **What it cannot see, and says.** Clicks out of Google AI Overviews arrive
 * as `google.com` and cannot be separated from search; Copilot mostly hides
 * under `bing.com`; crawlers never run the tracker at all. The ⓘ beside the
 * title carries the first of these, the one a reader would otherwise count
 * against themselves.
 *
 * **The panel is rows and nothing else**, like every other card (Abbas,
 * 2026-09-10). The share of all visitors rides beside the title, and the
 * total joins it only in the See all modal's header.
