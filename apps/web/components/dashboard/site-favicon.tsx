 * load-bearing: `faviconV2` answers a missing favicon with **404 plus a
 * generic globe in the body**, browsers draw the body of a 404 image
 * response, and gstatic sends no CORS headers — so from the browser there is
 * no way to tell "no favicon" from "here is one" and every unknown domain
 * rendered Google's grey globe. `/api/favicon` reads the status server-side
 * and answers a bodyless 404, which is what makes the fallbacks below

 * The radius is `xl` at the default size; small callers pass a proportional
 * one, since a 12px radius on a 20px box is just a circle again.
 *
 * A site with no origin allowlist has no domain to ask about, and that is a
 * normal state (an empty allowlist means "accept any origin"), so the
 * fallback is the site's own initial rather than a globe that would read as
 * "broken". Same for a favicon that fails to load — a letter still
