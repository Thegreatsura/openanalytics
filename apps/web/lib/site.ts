/**
 * The site's public identity, in one place.

 * Five files describe this deployment to machines — the metadata in the root
 * layout, `robots.txt`, `sitemap.xml`, `llms.txt` and the JSON-LD graph — and
 * every one of them needs the same three facts. Held separately they drift,
 * and a structured-data graph that disagrees with the OG card is worse than
 * no graph at all: it tells an answer engine two things and lets it pick.
 *
 * All of it is configuration, because this build is not only ours. A fork
 * that inherited our address would publish canonical URLs pointing at a site
 * it does not run, and an OG card that sends every share to a competitor.
 *
 * `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` values are inlined at build time, so these are set for the
 * build, not for the running container.
